# Public Folder

This folder contains static assets that are served directly by Next.js.

## Usage

Files in this folder can be referenced with a leading `/` in your code.

### Examples:

```tsx
// In your components
<Image src="/placeholder-watch.jpg" alt="Watch" />

// Or in CSS
background-image: url('/logo.svg');
```

## Recommended Structure

- `/images/` - Product images, collection images
- `/icons/` - Favicon, app icons
- `/fonts/` - Custom fonts (if any)

## Note

The `placeholder-watch.jpg` file is a placeholder. Replace it with actual watch images or use external image URLs in your product data.
